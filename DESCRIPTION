Title: View and exclude datapoints in multi-level long format dataframes

Description: Create data groupings in a multi-level long format dataframe (ldf) and overwrite specified values with NA:
	- Test a summary statistic (mean,sd,...) of each grouping's datapoints (e.g. trial durations) against a defineable criterion (e.g. >2) to find excludeable groupings. Mask parts of groupings (e.g. ignore accuracy datapoints) in the testing and/or exclusion phase and transfer exclusions found in fine-grained groupings (e.g. per participant, per session, per measure type (duration and accuracy)) to less fine-grained groupings (e.g. per participant, all sessions, all measure types).
	- Trim bottom and/or top datapoints within each grouping
	- Trim datapoints within each grouping that are more than X times the spread (sd, mad, ...) beyond the center (mean, median, ...) of the grouping's data.
	- Copy the trimming status from one type of datapoint to related types of datapoints.
	- View grouped data in point, line, histogram, density, box, or violin plots and name groupings to identify relevant datapoints or patterns.
	The package was designed to aid and speed up the process of reviewing multi-level raw data and quickly checking the downstream impact of different patterns of exclusion and trimming.
